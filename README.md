In this article, I will talk about Ridge regression, Lasso regression and ElasticNet Regression from the linear regression family.

Ridge regression is a type of linear regression and is used in regression analysis. Its purpose is to deal with the problem of overfitting the regression model so that it generalizes better. This method uses a regularization term that limits the regression coefficients. This regularization term reduces the complexity of the model and thus makes it more balanced. Ridge regression is particularly effective when there is a high correlation between regression coefficients and in multiple linear regression problems.

Lasso regression is also a type of linear regression and is used to reduce overfitting. However, unlike Ridge regression, Lasso regression focuses on eliminating redundant features. This method pushes the regression coefficients to zero and thus eliminates some of the model's coefficients altogether. In this way, the model becomes simpler and reduces unnecessary complexity. Lasso regression is particularly effective for feature selection and when you want to emphasize rare features.

ElasticNet regression is a combination of Ridge and Lasso regression. This method combines both the regularization effect of Ridge and the feature selection ability of Lasso. In this way, it combines the advantages of both methods and offers a more flexible solution. ElasticNet regression is particularly effective when working with high-dimensional data sets and features with multiple correlations. This method aims to create a more balanced regression model by reducing the disadvantages of Ridge and Lasso.

In this study, we created a randomly generated dataset of house prices and ran these three regression analyses on this dataset.
It was observed that the MSE values were almost equal to each other. We can say that ElasticNet Regression is more successful by a very small margin.

Which regression method to use usually depends on the characteristics of the data set and the purpose of the analysis. Here are some tips for deciding which regression method to use:

Ridge Regression:

If there is a high correlation between regression coefficients (most characteristics are closely related).
Multiple linear regression problems, especially if the number of features is greater than the number of data points.
If an overfitting problem arises and the model needs to be more stable.
Lasso Regression:

When feature selection is desired, i.e. when only important features are to be retained in the model.
If there are rare or unimportant features in the data set and these features need to be removed from the model.
If the model needs to be simplified and unnecessary complexity needs to be reduced.
ElasticNet Regression:

When you want to take advantage of the advantages of both Ridge and Lasso regressions.
When working with high-dimensional datasets and where both regularization and feature selection are important.
When Ridge and Lasso alone do not perform well.
Since each regression method has its advantages and disadvantages, choosing the right method is usually done by taking into account the characteristics of the data set and the purpose of the analysis. In order to understand the characteristics of your dataset and to decide which method is most appropriate for your dataset, it is important to first carefully examine your dataset.
